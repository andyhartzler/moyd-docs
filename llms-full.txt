# Missouri Young Democrats (MOYD)

> Missouri Young Democrats (MOYD) is the official statewide youth political organization dedicated to empowering young Missourians to lead in politics, policy, and public service. We mobilize high school, college, and young professional Democrats across all eight congressional districts to build progressive power, win elections, and shape the future of our state.

Founded to give young people a voice in Missouriâ€™s Democratic politics, MOYD provides leadership training, grassroots organizing opportunities, and a platform to influence public policy. We are officially affiliated with the Young Democrats of America (YDA), and work closely with the Missouri Democratic Party, Missouri College Democrats, and Missouri High School Democrats to create a pipeline of new leaders from the classroom to the State Capitol.

Our mission is rooted in three pillars:
- **Organizing:** Registering voters, launching local chapters, and building campaigns that reflect the priorities of young Missourians.  
- **Leadership Development:** Training the next generation of candidates, campaign staffers, and community advocates.  
- **Advocacy:** Advancing Democratic values on issues like reproductive freedom, climate action, education, labor rights, and protecting democracy.
